# The Unfollower

This is a web app that makes it easy to unfollow lots of playlists. The app will ask the user for their Spotify credentials, present all of the user's playlists and allow the user to quickly unfollow any of the playlists.  An unfollowed playlist can be refollowed.

This web app uses the Spotify Web API.
